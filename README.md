LoongSuite Pilot is a local telemetry collector for AI coding agents. It discovers supported agents on a developer machine, installs the required hooks or plugins, normalizes activity into a shared GenAI event schema, and exports logs or traces to your chosen backends.

## Why LoongSuite Pilot?

Development teams often use more than one AI coding agent, and each agent records activity in a different local format. Pilot gives teams one local collector that can discover those agents, collect their activity, normalize the data, and send it to destinations that are useful for analysis, audit, and observability.

Pilot is designed to answer practical questions:

- Which agents are being used?
- What model, session, turn, and tool activity happened?
- How much token usage is available from each agent?
- Where should the data be exported: local files, SLS, HTTP, or traces?
- How should sensitive prompts, tool arguments, and secrets be controlled before export?

## Core Capabilities


| Capability               | What Pilot Does                                                                    |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Agent discovery          | Detects supported agents from local paths and commands.                            |
| Collection deployment    | Installs hooks or plugins and reads local logs, sessions, or data files.           |
| Unified event schema     | Normalizes agent-native events into a shared GenAI schema.                         |
| Multi-destination output | Exports to JSONL, Alibaba Cloud SLS, HTTP, and OTLP trace backends.                |
| Privacy controls         | Supports per-agent content capture policy and secret masking before output.        |
| Local operations         | Provides service status, restart, rollback, and optional local dashboard commands. |

Agent definitions live in `agents.d/`. You can add new agents without changing the deployment framework; see [Agent Onboarding](docs/agent-onboarding.md).

## Quick Start

Prerequisites:

- Node.js 18 or later
- `npm`
- `curl` or `wget`

Install from the public package:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://loongcollector-community-edition.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/loongsuite-pilot/installer.sh -o /tmp/loongsuite-pilot-installer.sh && bash /tmp/loongsuite-pilot-installer.sh install
```

Verify the service:

```bash
loongsuite-pilot status
loongsuite-pilot info
```

Local JSONL output is enabled by default under `~/.loongsuite-pilot/logs/output/`.

For installer options, uninstall commands, and source builds, see [Installation](docs/installation.md).

## Configure Pilot

Configuration is loaded in this order: environment variables, then `~/.loongsuite-pilot/config.json`, then built-in defaults.

Start with the guide that matches what you want to change:

LoongSuite Pilot emits a normalized GenAI event schema across all supported agents. See [Output Event Schema](docs/output-event-schema.md) for event names, field definitions, provider values, finish reasons, and sensitivity notes for opt-in content fields.

## Operate Pilot

Use the `loongsuite-pilot` command after installation:

```bash
loongsuite-pilot start
loongsuite-pilot stop
loongsuite-pilot restart
loongsuite-pilot status
loongsuite-pilot info
loongsuite-pilot token-usage
loongsuite-pilot rollback
```

Optional local dashboard:

```bash
loongsuite-pilot monitor start
```

Then open `http://127.0.0.1:8765/`.
